his file is read to determine custom offset amounts for certain textures. It's read line by line, and once it reaches an offset amount, (signified with a double equal sign) all the names underneath will be added to it. It's measured in tiles, 0.5 is half a tile. "Variant" textures will use the default texture's offset values unless otherwise specified. The words after a double equal sign can be used as an explanatory comment.
