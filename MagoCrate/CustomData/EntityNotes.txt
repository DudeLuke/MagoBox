Magobox reads this txt file until it reaches a line containing "/[Object Category] [Object Type]"

Once there, it will print those notes into the window until it reaches
the dedicated ending substring "/;"

There's also a section that is always shown for that category: "/[Object Category] Default"
Use it for notes relating to everything in that category such as enemy behaviors.

/Object Default
The Object Editor has the unique feature of being able to view parameter values in decimal (default) or in hexadecimal. Strangely high values may be better understood when viewing the hex value equivalent. 4294967295 for instance, is equal to FFFFFFFF, or -1.

A lot of objects with similar purposes share what each parameter does. For example, objects that take you to new rooms (doors, warpstars, fuse cannons, etc) all use Parameter 3 for how many rooms or "steps" you move forward.
-- 0 loads the same step you're already in.
-- FFFFFFFF takes you back one step, FFFFFFFE takes you back two steps, etc.

Likewise, Parameter 5 often controls an object's "Event ID" which allows you to connect "input" objects to "output" objects. A Switch with Event ID 6 will open a shutter door of Event ID 6 and so-on.

/Object [0]
This is the object used for all doors, including ones at the end of a stage.

Parameter 1 controls whether the door is hidden by default. It appears when the midboss in that room is defeated or when a certain amount of time has passed. 0 is false, 1 is true.

Parameter 2 controls whether entering the door ends the stage. 0 is false, 1 is true.

Parameter 3 controls how many steps forward the door leads to.

Parameter 4 controls the start point ID, i.e. going through a door with param 4 set to 8 will take you to the start point with param 4 set to 8.

Parameter 6 controls the door's appearance:
0: 3 Star Door, no black backdrop.
1: 5 Star Door, no backdrop. (Challenge Stage exit)
2: Invisible, used for secret doors.
3: 3 Star Door with backdrop.
4: Level Exit Door, uses 1 for Param 2.
5: Orange Star Door, no backdrop.
6: Orange Star Door with backdrop.

Parameter 7 controls roughly how many frames it takes for a door to appear if it's hidden via Parameter 1. If 0, it won't open on its own.

/Object [5]
The starting position for Kirby in a room. If there are no dedicated spawn positions for players 2-4, then they will spawn here behind Kirby.

Parameter 4 controls the start point ID, i.e. going through a door with param 4 set to 8 will take you to the start point with param 4 set to 8.

Parameter 6 controls the starting facing direction for players entering that room. 0 is right, 1 is left.
/;

/Object [6]
The star shaped portals usually spawned via destroying something blocking it with a Super Ability. If the room has the AD greyscale effect, the star appears sky blue and doesn't remove your ability on entering.

Parameter 3 controls how many steps forward the door leads to and Parameter 5 controls the Start Point ID.
/;

/Object [7]
Warpstar that takes Kirby to a new room like a door. Its specific animation and movement is based on the value in Parameter 6.

Simply points in a direction, though like Pop Flowers and Guide Signs, it can also be destroyed by Super Abilities. Parameter 6 controls the arrow direction.
0: Right
1: Left
2: Up
3: Down
/;

/Object [9]
The stage the door takes you to is based on both Parameter 3 and 4. Parameter 3 controls which level, and Parameter 4 controls which stage. (Both values must be one less than the expected value, 0 is treated as 1.)
-- For example, 5-3 has the values 4 and 2 respectively.
/;

/Object [10]
Parameter 6 (best viewed using Hex values) controls both the length of the supporting rope (in tiles) and the distance it falls when cut (also in tiles).

/Object [11]
Both used to either make zoomed out cameras or lock them at this object's position. Parameter 6 controls its behavior.
-- Hard Lock: You're stuck in the camera's bounds, and the camera gets locked as soon as you enter the room, no matter the distance.
-- Soft Lock: Camera moves to the object's position when in range, but you can walk out of range to cancel the lock.
-- Free Cam: Camera moves like normal, often used for different levels of zoom for the room.

/Object [17]
A Switch that starts a timer when activate output objects with the matching Event ID. Once the timer runs out, it deactivates those objects and can be pressed again.

Parameter 6 controls how long the timer lasts. (in frames)
/;

/Object [18]
When an input with a matching Event ID is pressed, the block on the same coordinate will be triggered, whether that be a bomb chain block, its variants, or even the snow blocks destroyed by Goriath! Most commonly though, its just used to start bomb block chains using an input object instead of a bomb block.

/Object [26]
Fuses, they automatically string together when organized.

If the fuse is the end piece, parameter 5 controls event ID. It can be used an an input for any output object, but level designs exclusively use fuse cannons. If the end piece also has Parameter 7 set to 1, the fuse will regenerate.

Parameter 6 controls the fuse's orientations
0: Up and Down
1: Left and Right
2: Right and Up
3: Left and Up

/Object [30]
Shutters Doors, like the locked versions, extend in a certain direction from the bottom. They use event IDs to turn on and are some of the few objects compatible with "untoggle" triggers such as expiring timed switches or toggle switches when used a second time. Most of their traits is controlled by Parameter 6 (Best viewed as a hex value).
-- 000X0Y0Z
---- X: Direction, 0 opens upward, 1 opens right, 2 opens left.
---- Y: Size Type, when set to 1, it uses a unique model and collision that's 5 tiles long instead of 3.
---- Z: Controls skin when Size Type isn't 1.
0: Normal
1: Laser (Damages you on touch)
2: Iron (Used in Egg Engines)

When in the Lor Starcutter steps, specifically "In01" through "In06", The default shutter skin is replaced with the Lor Starcutter Shutter variant. While the other variants are still accessible, changing direction type, even for the ones that would otherwise normally work, will crash.

Why HAL didn't just add a third skin for Lor Starcutter doors still baffles me.
/;

/Object [35]
These blocks connect to other Flare Beam Switches with a matching event ID, when they're all lit by Flare Beam, they emit sparkle effects which travels toward the closest Shutter Door with that same event ID. They seemingly can only power shutter doors.

/Object [42]
Wind is one of three "zone" objects. These kinds of objects create an affected area in the room based on their Parameter 6 and Parameter 7 values (Both of these values are best viewed in hex). While the level designers tend to place the objects at the top-left corner of where they affect, the position and range of the zone relies solely on these parameters. Distances are measured in "units" or 1/16th of a tile, so 10 (hexadecimal equivalent to 16) is the distance of a single tile.

Pushing Wind pushes you along, either to speed up a section or make areas traversable in only one direction

Parameter 6 is the coordinates of the upper-left corner
-- XXXXYYYY
---- X: how many units right of (0,0).
---- Y: how many units above (0,0).

Parameter 7 is other wind settings
-- XXXYYYZW
---- X: Size in X direction to the right in units.
---- Y: Size in Y direction downward in units.
---- Z: Wind direction.
0: Up
2: Right
4: Down
6: Left
---- W: Wind strength.
/;

/Object [44]
A Trigger is one of three "zone" objects. These kinds of objects create an affected area in the room based on their Parameter 6 and Parameter 7 values (Both of these values are best viewed in hex). While the level designers tend to place the objects at the top-left corner of where they affect, the position and range of the zone relies solely on these parameters. Distances are measured in "units" or 1/16th of a tile, so 10 (hexadecimal equivalent to 16) is the distance of a single tile.

Trigger Areas serve as an input object. When you enter the zone area, it sends an activation signal to output objects with a matching Event ID.

Parameter 6 is the coordinates of the upper-left corner
-- XXXXYYYY
---- X: how many units right of (0,0).
---- Y: how many units above (0,0).

Parameter 7 is other trigger settings
-- XXXYYYZW
---- X: Size in X direction to the right in units.
---- Y: Size in Y direction downward in units.
---- Z: Unknown, has to be "1" to work properly.
---- W: Set this value to 2 and the trigger will send a deactivation signal when Kirby exits the zone area, allowing for it to do things like closing shutter doors.
/;

/Object [45]
Bubbles are one of three "zone" objects. These kinds of objects create an affected area in the room based on their Parameter 6 and Parameter 7 values (Both of these values are best viewed in hex). While the level designers tend to place the objects at the top-left corner of where they affect, the position and range of the zone relies solely on these parameters. Distances are measured in "units" or 1/16th of a tile, so 10 (hexadecimal equivalent to 16) is the distance of a single tile.

Pushing Bubbles objects function identically to Pushing Wind, only that it uses different sounds and effects

Parameter 6 is the coordinates of the upper-left corner
-- XXXXYYYY
---- X: how many units right of (0,0).
---- Y: how many units above (0,0).

Parameter 7 is other bubble settings
-- XXXYYYZW
---- X: Size in X direction to the right in units.
---- Y: Size in Y direction downward in units.
---- Z: Water flow direction.
0: Up
2: Right
4: Down
6: Left
---- W: Water flow strength.

/Object [52]
Isn't actually necessary to make Flare Beam switches work, simply focuses the little sparkles of light the switches make when all alight. Parameter values seemingly aren't used, and instead seems to work based on proximity.
/;

/Object [90]
This is a unique "zone" object like wind and triggers, though it functions differently. Parameter 6 through Parameter 9 are all used instead of just 6 and 7. While the level designers tend to place the objects at the top-left corner of where they affect, the position and range of the zone relies solely on these parameters. Distances are measured in "units" or 1/16th of a tile, so in hex values, 10 (hexadecimal equivalent to 16) is the distance of a single tile.

When placed into a room, all enemies with "Has super ability" checked won't spawn by proximity and will instead spawn when you walk into the area defined by the zone. It spawns enemies in order from left to right one after the other.

Parameter 6 - X coordinate of zone's top left corner.
Parameter 7 - Y coordinate of zone's top left corner.
Parameter 8 - How far to the right it expands
Parameter 9 - How far to the left it expands.

=-=-=-=-=-= Enemies =-=-=-=-=-=
/Enemy Default
Level can be read in Mint or in the hardcoded ASM to change enemies, whether it be to make them move faster or alter some other part of an enemy. 

Direction Type usually changes the starting direction of the enemy, though it can have other purposes for certain behaviors.
0: Attempts to face the closest player.
1: Always faces Right.
2: Always faces Left.

Behavior affects an enemy's AI. Enemies usually require a specific behavior to work right (which for most usual enemies is automatically assigned here) but there are some universally compatible behaviors which are as follows:
0: Does nothing.
1: Walks forward, falls off edges.
2: Walks forward, turns at edges.
3: Walks and patrols within 5 tiles.
4: Hovers in place.
5: Hovers vertically within 5 tiles.
-- Always locked facing direction.
6: Flies forward in a sin wave.
7: Flies up before homing in on you.
8: Does nothing.
